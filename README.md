# Hi, I'm Christoph 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about learning and creating products that make a
difference. I also love dabbling with all things infrastructure and figuring out how things work
behind the scenes.

I do not actively use GitHub right now. Most of my code is over on [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~cschmatzler).

I try to write things at my blog, [The Medium Place](https://medium.place), so feel free to check
out my thoughts there and subscribe to the RSS feed if it interests you.  
For short-form thoughts also spanning my personal life, check out my
[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@cschmatzler).
