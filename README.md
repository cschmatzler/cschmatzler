# Hi, I'm Christoph 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about learning and creating products that make a
difference. I also love dabbling with all things infrastructure and figuring out how things work
behind the scenes. Nowadays, I mostly write Elixir, where 
[Idiom](https://github.com/cschmatzler/idiom) is my current open-source focus. It's an
internationalisation library, and if you ask me, it's pretty cool.  

I try to write things at my blog, [The Medium Place](https://medium.place), so feel free to check
out my thoughts there and subscribe to the RSS feed if it interests you.
